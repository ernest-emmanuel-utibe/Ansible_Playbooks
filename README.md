Below are step-by-step instructions for launching, stopping, starting, and terminating AWS EC2 instances using Ansible:

1. **Launching EC2 Instances:**

   **Step 1: Set up your Ansible environment:**
   
   - Make sure you have Ansible installed on your local machine.
   - Configure your AWS credentials either by setting environment variables or using AWS CLI configuration.
   - Create an inventory file (e.g., `inventory.ini`) with the details of the EC2 instances you want to manage.

   **Step 2: Write the Ansible playbook:**

   ``` yaml
   # launch_ec2_instances.yml
   
   ---
   - name: Launch EC2 Instances
     hosts: localhost
     gather_facts: no
     tasks:
       - name: Launch EC2 instances
         ec2_instance:
           count: 1
           instance_type: t2.micro
           image: {YOUR AMI} # Replace with your desired AMI ID
           key_name: {YOUR KEYPAIR}
           security_group: {YOUR SECURITY GROUP}
           wait: yes
         register: ec2_result
   ```

   **Step 3: Run the playbook:**
   
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini launch_ec2_instances.yml
   ```

2. **Stopping EC2 Instances:**

   **Step 1: Write the Ansible playbook:**
   
   ```yaml
   # stop_ec2_instances.yml
   
   ---
   - name: Stop EC2 Instances
     hosts: localhost
     gather_facts: no
     tasks:
       - name: Stop EC2 instances
         local_action:
           module: ec2
           args:
             instance_ids:
               - "{YOUR INSTANCE ID}"  # Replace with your instance ID
             state: stopped
         register: stopped_instances
   ```

   **Step 2: Run the playbook:**
   
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini stop_ec2_instances.yml
   ```

3. **Starting EC2 Instances:**

   **Step 1: Write the Ansible playbook:**
   
   ```yaml
   # start_ec2_instances.yml
   
   ---
   - name: Start EC2 Instances
     hosts: localhost
     gather_facts: no
     tasks:
       - name: Start EC2 instances
         local_action:
           module: ec2
           args:
             instance_ids:
               - "{YOUR INSTANCE ID}"  # Replace with your instance ID
             state: started
         register: started_instances
   ```

   **Step 2: Run the playbook:**
   
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini start_ec2_instances.yml
   ```

4. **Terminating EC2 Instances:**

   **Step 1: Write the Ansible playbook:**
   
   ```yaml
   # terminate_ec2_instances.yml
   
   ---
   - name: Terminate EC2 Instances
     hosts: localhost
     gather_facts: no
     tasks:
       - name: Terminate EC2 instances
         local_action:
           module: ec2
           args:
             instance_ids:
               - "{YOUR INSTANCE ID}"  # Replace with your instance ID
             state: absent
         register: terminated_instances
   ```

   **Step 2: Run the playbook:**
   
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini terminate_ec2_instances.yml
   ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to perform each action (launching, stopping, starting, and terminating) on your AWS EC2 instances using Ansible playbooks. Make sure to replace placeholder values such as AMI IDs and instance IDs with actual values from your AWS environment.
